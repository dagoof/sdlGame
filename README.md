Prerequisites:
    A Game written with the SDL framework based on the youtube series:
        Vertstudio 3D: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPsK6vduM-ZqbszTuzNJrcQ

    Required frameworks:
        SDL2 and SDL2_Image

    Required PNG files:
        Currently required to be downloaded from Vertstudio 3D

    The game is written in OSX so the framework linking in the makefile is for OSX.
    The source code is, at least I feel fairly different, especially in organization

    The artwork required might be uploaded at a different date.

Installing:
    After putting the image files and installing required frameworks.
    Use "make" command from the makefile

Running:
    Use ./fun to run the generated binary
